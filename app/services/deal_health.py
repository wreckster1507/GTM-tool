"""
Deal health scoring engine.

Score 0–100 across three dimensions:
  - Engagement recency   (40 pts) — how recently was there activity?
  - Stakeholder coverage (30 pts) — how many stakeholders are engaged?
  - Stage velocity       (30 pts) — is the deal moving or stalling?

Maps to: green (70+) | yellow (40–69) | red (0–39)
