"""
Channel-disposition side effects.

A single place that mirrors the rep's manual channel actions (call disposition,
LinkedIn touch) back into the contact's machine state: sequence_status,
follow-up tasks, Instantly campaign state.

Why this exists
---------------
Before this module, derivation lived in the frontend (`prospectWorkflow.ts`)
and the client sent the updated sequence_status along with the PATCH. That
worked for the happy path but:
  1. Trusted the client for state transitions.
  2. Didn't auto-create follow-up tasks (rep logs "interested" but no "book a
     call" task appeared until the periodic system-task refresh ran).
  3. Didn't pause the Instantly campaign on DNC — the prospect kept receiving
     emails for days after the rep said "do not contact".

Putting the logic in one backend helper means every caller — PUT /contacts,
Instantly webhook, Aircall webhook, CSV import future actions — gets the
same behavior for free.
