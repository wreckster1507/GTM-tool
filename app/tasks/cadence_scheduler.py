"""
Multichannel cadence scheduler — Celery beat task.

For every contact with a `sequence_plan.steps` list, walks the plan and,
whenever a non-email step's `day_offset` has elapsed since the sequence was
launched, creates a "system" task for the rep to complete that touch. Email
steps are skipped because Instantly already sends those.

Why this exists
---------------
Before this, `sequence_plan` was a static artifact: account sourcing wrote
{email/call/linkedin × day_offset} into enrichment_data, but nothing
actually walked the list or surfaced the call/LinkedIn steps to the rep.
Reps treated each channel as a separate to-do, losing the cadence. Now the
scheduler turns the plan into live tasks that appear in the rep's queue on
the right day.

Idempotency
-----------
Each created Task has a stable `system_key` of
`cadence:{sequence_id or contact_id}:step{index}` so we never create the
same step task twice; `_upsert_system_task` silently updates if already
present.

Skipping rules
--------------
- Skip email steps (Instantly owns those).
- Skip if the contact's `sequence_status` is a terminal state
  (meeting_booked / not_interested / unsubscribed / bounced / completed).
- Skip step day_offset=0 of the first email step is the launch itself —
  we don't duplicate.
- Skip if the step's day hasn't arrived yet.
- Skip if a later channel has already been logged (e.g., if the call on day
  3 was done, don't re-create the task).
